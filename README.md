# a7-collaborative-coding

##### 1. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who.

> As a group we helped each other and asked Michael Freeman for help too.

##### 2. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge?

> Altogether, approximately 8 hours

##### 3. On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this challenge?

> 6

##### 4. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better?

> We had issues with the summary_information.r file, we kept getting a colnames error ```(Error in `colnames<-`(`*tmp*`, value = c("class_standing", "applying_to_major",  : 
  attempt to set 'colnames' on an object with less than two dimensions)``` or ```Error: object 'command' not found```. We believe the challenge was at a good level of difficulty for a first collaborative homework. It would be better if we had more practice with making functions that work in an index.rmd file during class or something similar to using the summary_information file although we understand we were being taught more about how to fix issues with commiting and merging.
